INTRO TO HTML

HTML + CSS + JS

HTML provides the basic structure (CSS styles, JS behaviors)

HTML alone should still have hiearchery and should be readable

<tags></tags>

It is simply a text file!

(Markup = tags to markup content)

attributes (<a href="#">)

<em> to show nesting

Two parts - tags and attributes

(lot of html types such as html 5.0, xhtml, don't worry about it) Syntax is the most important thing, and you can learn functionality as you grow

GETTING STARTED
---
declare DOCTYPE - this let's the browser know what to expect. HTML - knows how to read it.
<!DOCTYPE HTML>

An HTML is document is like a sandwich. These tags are the bread.
<html>
	
</html>

The head is like the condiments. Not exciting on their own, but important.
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- tells the browser what charset to use -->
		<meta name="description" content="A page for exploring basic HTML documents"> <!-- description for search engines and other web crawlers -->
		<title>Page Title</title> <!-- what apears in the header and tabs -->
</head>

The body is the meet and cheese. It is where all the content goes
<body>
	<!-- all the good stuff -->
</body>
